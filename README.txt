Many of the systems in this project could be split into smaller fully independent pieces, which would be the right thing to do for a larger project to minimize potential coupling and make future development work easier.

But for this small project I decided that spliting my systems into smaller pieces would lead to more pointless boilerplate, and DOTS already has too much boilerplate.
